### Abstract:
In this project, we have practiced the build-up
process of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) on the Google
Colab platform, and used the CNN model we selected and
built with package mainly TensorFlow and Keras to practice
in predicting a set of modifies MNIST dataset. After the
investigation of different CNN models available to us, we found
the best option for this task: VGG-16, and customized the layers
based on the model preset to optimize its performance. The
competition results show its outstanding performance among
all candidates we chose and achieved an accuracy of 97.3%
in the Kaggle competition. In this project, we have gathered
knowledge of implementing CNN model in practice and predict
the dataset from the real world, proved this knowledge is
effective and can be used as instructions for the model building
and modifying afterwards.
